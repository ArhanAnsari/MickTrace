# 🔐 Security Policy

Security is a top priority for the **MickTrace** project.  
We take all vulnerability reports seriously and appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security issues.

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, **please DO NOT create a public GitHub issue**.  
Instead, report it privately via email to:

Please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability  
- Steps to reproduce it  
- Possible impact and affected versions  
- Any suggested fix or mitigation  

We’ll acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and aim to provide a fix or update within **7–14 days**, depending on severity.

## 🧩 Responsible Disclosure

We ask that you:
- Refrain from publicly disclosing details of vulnerabilities until a patch is released  
- Avoid exploiting the issue or causing harm to others  
- Allow us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure  

Responsible reporters will be **credited in the release notes** (if desired).

## 🧱 Security Best Practices

When using MickTrace in production, we recommend:

- Keeping dependencies updated (`pip install --upgrade MickTrace`)  
- Avoiding exposure of sensitive logs in public dashboards  
- Using secure configuration for any cloud or remote log storage  
- Following general Python security guidelines (PEP 458, 480)
